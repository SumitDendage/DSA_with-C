Algorithm for Evaluation of Postfix Expression

Requirements

1. A postfix string to store the postfix expression accepted from user
2. A stack to store the values of operands

Steps

1. Stack is initialised
2. Accept the postfix expression in postfix string
3. Accept the values for operands
4. Read the character from postfix string
5. If it is an operand, push it's value in stack
6. If it is an operator,
	pop 2 values from stack,
	apply the operator to these values
	& push the result in stack
7. If the postfix string has not ended, go to step 4
8. Pop the result from stack & display
