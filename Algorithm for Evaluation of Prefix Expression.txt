Algorithm for Evaluation of Prefix Expression

Requirements

1. A prefix string to store the prefix expression accepted from user
2. A stack to store the values of operands

Steps

1. Stack is initialised
2. Accept the prefix expression in prefix string
3. Accept the values for operands
4. Read the prefix expression from Right to Left
5. If it is an operand, push it's value in stack
6. If it is an operator,
	pop 2 values from stack,
	apply the operator to these 2 values
	& push the result in stack
7. If the prefix string has not ended, go to step 4
8. Pop the result from stack & display
