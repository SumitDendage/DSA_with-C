Queue

A Queue is an ordered collection of items in which the items are inserted from one position (rear) & removed from another position (front). A queue operates on FIFO principle i.e. first in first out. This means the queue works on First Come, First Serve principle. 

For applications of Queue, refer to DSF Notes.

Primitive Operations on Queue
1. Queue is initialised
2. add elements to queue from rear position
3. remove elements from queue from front position
4. check queue full
5. check queue empty

Like stacks, queues can also be implemented using a static data structure like array or a dynamic data structure like linked list.

There are different types of queues like linear queue, DEQUEUE, Circular Queue & Priority Queue.
