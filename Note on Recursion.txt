Recursion

If a function calls itself then such a function is called as a recursive function & the process is called as "recursion". In other words, if the calling and the called function are same, then the function is said to be recursive. A recursive function can be seen as an alternative to looping command. This function must contain a conditional statement alongwith "return" statement. If not, the function will call itself endlessly i.e. will not terminate & will lead to an error similar to "endless loop".


factorial value of 5 = 5 x factorial value of 4 =  5 x  24   =   120
